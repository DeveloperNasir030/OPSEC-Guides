10. Use an offline authenticator like Aegis instead of Google Authenticator.
11. Enable auto permission revoke for unused apps.
12. Disable Google telemetry: Web & App Activity, Location History, Ad Personalization.
13. Use a firewall like RethinkDNS or NetGuard to monitor app connections.
14. Restrict background data for apps that don’t need it.
15. Inspect system services with “adb shell dumpsys package” or App Manager.
16. Use Airplane mode + Bluetooth off before plugging into unknown USB ports.
17. Replace Samsung/Google keyboard with OpenBoard for zero telemetry.
18. Encrypt local photos/files before uploading to cloud storage (Cryptomator or EDS Lite).
19. Keep lockscreen timeout short (15 sec) and disable “lock instantly with power button.”
20. Flash the latest firmware manually via Odin if Samsung OTA updates are delayed.
21. Use “adb logcat” while idle to watch for suspicious background network activity.
22. Disable Find My Mobile if your threat model includes Samsung/Google tracking.
23. Use a clean backup device (same model) ready for instant switch if compromise suspected.
